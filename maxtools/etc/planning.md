# Planning

## Internals:
- [ ] Clean up all code,
- [ ] Re-work Consort segment maker mix in

## CueVoiceSpanner
- [ ] Make the cue numbering pretty
- [ ] Make annotations for automatic CueItems (this will involve changes in Patchertools)

## Patchertools
- [ ] Rework MaxPatcher's Cue Voice maker to put CueItem indications in the Cue Voice.

## Package
- [ ] Place the Max Patcher template project in this Package to be shared
- [ ] (Place Max Patcher template project in its own vc and include it as a submodule?)

## Documentation
- [ ] Research documentation types (maybe prefer Abjad's)
- [ ] Implement main documentation
