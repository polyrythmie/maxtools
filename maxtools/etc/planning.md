# Planning

## Internals:
- [ ] Clean up all code,
- [ ] Re-work Consort segment maker mix in, add citations

## Package
- [ ] Place the Max Patcher template project in this Package to be shared
- [ ] (Place Max Patcher template project in its own vc and include it as a submodule?)

## Documentation
- [ ] Research documentation types (maybe prefer Abjad's)
- [ ] Implement main documentation

# Future
- [ ] Implement Jamoma-style cues and JSON cues, definable per-patcher.
- [ ] Router max abstractions to automate creation of patch
- [ ] Route output to score markup
