# Planning

## Internals:
- [ ] Clean up all code,
- [ ] Re-work Consort segment maker mix in, add citations

## CueVoice
- [ ] Make the cue numbering pretty
- [ ] Make annotations for automatic CueItems

## Patchertools
- [x] Rework MaxPatcher's Cue Voice maker to put CueItem indications in the Cue Voice.
- [ ] Make sure router can differentiate between persistent settings and events
- [x] (Make sure cues can tell if they equal each other or override each other)

## Package
- [ ] Place the Max Patcher template project in this Package to be shared
- [ ] (Place Max Patcher template project in its own vc and include it as a submodule?)

## Documentation
- [ ] Research documentation types (maybe prefer Abjad's)
- [ ] Implement main documentation

# Future
- [ ] Other ways besides [coll]s to load/save cues. Maybe JSON
- [ ] Router max abstractions to automate creation of patch
- [ ] Route output to score markup
